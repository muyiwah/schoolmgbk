   - Request: `{ "email": "user@example.com", "otp": "123456", "newPassword": "newpass" }`
   - Response: `{ "success": true, "message": "Password has been reset successfully" }`

3. **POST /api/auth/verify-otp**
   - Request: `{ "email": "user@example.com", "otp": "123456" }`
   - Response: `{ "success": true, "message": "OTP verified successfully", "expiresAt": 1234567890 }`
